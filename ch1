# Mastering spaCy

"""Tips for the reader
This book is a practical guide. In order to get the most out of the book,
recommend readers replicate the code in their own Python shell.
Without following and performing the code, it is not possible to get a
proper understanding of NLP concepts and spaCy methods, which is why we
have arranged the upcoming chapters in the following way:
 - Explanation of the language/ML concept
 - Application code with spaCy
 - Evaluation of the outcome
 - Challenges of the methodology
 - Pro tips and tricks to overcome the challenges"""
